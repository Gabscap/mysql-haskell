mysql-haskell
=============

`mysql-haskell` is a mysql driver written entirely in haskell by Winterland at infrastructure department of Didi group, it's going to be used in projects aiming at replacing old java based mysql middlewares.

Roadmap:

- [x] username/password authenticate
- [x] text protocol decoding
- [x] binary protocol decoding
- [x] binlog listening
- [x] basic binlog parsing
- [ ] comprehensive testsuit and benchmark
- [x] full binlog parsing 
- [ ] polish and stablize API
- [ ] tls support

This project is still in infancy stage and lack of produciton tests, use on your own risk, and any form of contributions are welcomed!

Motivation
----------

While mysql may not be the most advanced sql database, it's widely used among china companies, including but not limited to Baidu, Alibaba, Tecent etc., but haskell's mysql support is not ideal, we only have a very basic mysql binding written by Bryan O'Sullivan, and some higher level wrapper built on it, which have some problems:

+ lack of prepared statment and binary protocol support.

+ limited concurrency due to FFI.

+ no replication protocol support.

mysql-haskell is intended to solve these problems, and providing foundation for higher level libraries such as groundhog and persistent, so that accessing mysql is both fast and easy in haskell.

Building
--------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/winterland1989/mysql-haskell.git
cd mysql-haskell
cabal new-build
```

You can use `stack` or `cabal.project` file to add extra dependency.

Guide
-----

Currently document is extremely lacking, you may find something you need in `Database.MySQL.Base` module.
